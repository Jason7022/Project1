# Phase 1 – Design Artifacts

This folder contains all deliverables for Phase 1.

## Contents
- **BNF**: `BNF.pdf` (final grammar of the LOLCODE Markdown subset)
- **ANTLR 3 Grammar**: `lolspeakGrammar.g`
- **(Optional) ANTLR 4 Grammar**: `lolspeakGrammar.g4`
- **AI/LLM Usage**:
  - `AI_transcript.txt` – pasted excerpts used to produce/iterate on the grammar
  - `AI_links.txt` – permalinks to the AI conversations

## Notes
- Grammar decisions documented inline (token choices, case-insensitivity, hashed keywords).
- Comments placement and block ordering (e.g., `#MAEK HEAD` rule) are enforced both in BNF and the ANTLR grammar.
